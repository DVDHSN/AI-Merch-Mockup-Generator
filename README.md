ü§ñ AI Merch Mockup Generator
An open-source, AI-powered tool to generate realistic mockups for your merchandise designs in seconds. Simply upload your logo, describe the scene, and let AI create a unique, high-quality image of a model wearing your design.



üìÑ Description
The AI Merch Mockup Generator is a powerful yet easy-to-use application designed for creators, designers, and e-commerce entrepreneurs. It leverages the capabilities of state-of-the-art text-to-image AI via an external API to eliminate the need for expensive photoshoots and complex design software.

With this tool, you can:

Instantly visualize your t-shirt, hoodie, or other apparel designs on AI-generated models.
Create diverse and unique promotional materials for your online store or social media.
Experiment with different styles, settings, and model appearances using simple text prompts.
The application intelligently removes the background from your logo, generates a base image according to your prompt via the AI service, and seamlessly overlays your design onto the apparel, giving you full control over its size and position.
