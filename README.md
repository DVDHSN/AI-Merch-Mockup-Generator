## üìÑ Description

The AI Merch Mockup Generator is a powerful yet easy-to-use application designed for creators, designers, and e-commerce entrepreneurs. It leverages the capabilities of state-of-the-art text-to-image AI via an external API to eliminate the need for expensive photoshoots and complex design software.

With this tool, you can:
- Instantly visualize your t-shirt, hoodie, or other apparel designs on AI-generated models.
- Create diverse and unique promotional materials for your online store or social media.
- Experiment with different styles, settings, and model appearances using simple text prompts.

The application intelligently removes the background from your logo, generates a base image according to your prompt via the AI service, and seamlessly overlays your design onto the apparel, giving you full control over its size and position.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **AI-Powered Image Generation**: Connects to an external AI service to create high-resolution, photorealistic images from text prompts.
- **Automatic Background Removal**: Intelligently removes the background from your uploaded logo for a clean overlay.
- **Customizable Logo Placement**: Easy-to-use sliders to precisely control the size, horizontal, and vertical position of your logo on the mockup.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the AI Merch Mockup Generator running on your local machine.

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- An API key for the integrated AI service.

**Step-by-step Guide:**

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DVDHSN/AI-Merch-Mockup-Generator.git
    cd AI-Merch-Mockup-Generator
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install the required Python packages using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure API Key**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API key for the external AI service:
    ```
    AI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

6.  **Access the Web UI**
    Once the script is running, you will see a local URL in your terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`). Open this URL in your web browser to start creating mockups.

## üí° Usage

Using the application is straightforward:

1.  **Upload Logo**: Drag and drop or click to upload your logo image (PNG with a transparent background works best).
2.  **Write a Prompt**: In the "Prompt" text box, describe the model and the scene you want. Be specific for better results.
    - *Example: "Photo of a young man with blonde hair wearing a plain black t-shirt, standing in a sunny park."*
3.  **Add a Negative Prompt (Optional)**: In the "Negative Prompt" text box, describe what you want to *avoid* in the image.
    - *Example: "blurry, logos, text, watermark, extra limbs, poorly drawn, cartoon"*
4.  **Adjust Logo Position**: Use the sliders for "Logo Size", "Horizontal Position", and "Vertical Position" to place the logo exactly where you want it on the t-shirt.
5.  **Generate**: Click the **"Generate Mockup"** button and wait for the AI service to create your image. The final mockup will appear in the output panel.
