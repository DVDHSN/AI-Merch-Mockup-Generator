### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8 or higher

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/DVDHSN/AI-Merch-Mockup-Generator.git
    cd AI-Merch-Mockup-Generator
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    -   **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```sh
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    -   **On Windows:**
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"
    ```
    This step is recommended for security. Alternatively, you can enter the key directly in the app's UI.

5.  **Run the Application**
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Your web browser should automatically open to the application's URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage

Once the application is running, follow these simple steps:

1.  If you did not set up the `.env` file, enter your OpenAI API key in the text input field in the sidebar.
2.  In the main text area, type a detailed description of the design you want to generate. Be as descriptive as possible for the best results!
    -   *Example prompt: "A minimalist line art drawing of a cat wearing glasses, vintage style."*
3.  Click the **"Generate Mockup"** button.
4.  Please wait a few moments while the DALL-E 3 API generates your design and the application creates the mockup.
5.  The final T-shirt mockup will be displayed on the page.
6.  Click the **"Download Mockup"** button to save the final image as a PNG file to your computer.
